- Do NOT add anything not explicitly listed

3. SKILLS MUST BE EXPLICIT:
- ONLY include terms that appear in a clear "Skills"/"Technical Skills" section
- Or when listed in format: "Skills: Java, Python" (extract ["Java", "Python"])
- NEVER include skills from:
    * Job descriptions ("Worked on Java projects" â‰  "Java" skill)
    * Project descriptions
    * Summary/objective statements

4. EMPTY ARRAYS WHEN MISSING:
- If section doesn't exist in text, return empty array
- Never invent entries to fill arrays
