# 🎯 Advanced Similarity Matching System

## 📊 **Day 4 Implementation - Advanced AI Matching**

Your AI recruitment system now has a sophisticated similarity matching engine that goes far beyond basic keyword matching!

---

## 🚀 **What We Built Today**

### 1. **Advanced Matching Engine** (`src/matching/advanced_matcher.py`)
- **Multi-factor scoring algorithm** with 7 components
- **Fuzzy skill matching** with synonyms and abbreviations  
- **Geographic location compatibility** with distance calculation
- **Experience level matching** with intelligent over/under-qualification handling
- **Semantic similarity** using AI embeddings
- **Industry experience matching**
- **Education requirement verification**

### 2. **RESTful Similarity API** (`src/api/similarity_search_api.py`)
- **5 powerful endpoints** for different matching scenarios
- **Bulk processing** for handling multiple requests
- **Detailed match explanations** with actionable recommendations
- **Integration with your existing OpenSearch infrastructure**

## 🧠 **Scoring Algorithm Details**

### **Component Weights**
```python
Skills Matching:      35% (Most Important)
Experience Level:     25% (Very Important) 
Semantic Similarity:  20% (AI-powered)
Location Compatibility: 10%
Education Requirements: 5%
Industry Experience:   3%
Salary Compatibility:  2%
```

### **Skills Matching Features**
- **Exact matching**: "Python" = "Python" (100%)
- **Fuzzy matching**: "JavaScript" ≈ "JS" (85%)
- **Synonym matching**: "Machine Learning" = "ML" = "AI" (85%)
- **Technology clusters**: React/Vue/Angular → Frontend frameworks

### **Experience Matching Logic**
- **Perfect match**: Candidate experience within job range (100%)
- **Under-qualified**: Graduated penalty based on gap
- **Over-qualified**: Moderate penalty for senior candidates in junior roles
- **Intelligent parsing**: "Senior (5+ years)" → 5-10 year range

## 🔗 **API Endpoints**

### **1. Health Check**
```bash
GET /health
```
Check if the API is running and OpenSearch is connected.

### **2. Find Resumes for Job**
```bash
POST /search/resumes
{
  "job_id": "job-123",
  "limit": 10,
  "min_score": 60.0
}
```
Returns top matching candidates with detailed scoring.

### **3. Find Jobs for Resume**
```bash
POST /search/jobs
{
  "resume_id": "resume-456",
  "limit": 10, 
  "min_score": 60.0
}
```
Returns best job opportunities for a candidate.

### **4. Detailed Match Analysis**
```bash
POST /match/detailed
{
  "resume_id": "resume-456",
  "job_id": "job-123"
}
```
Deep dive analysis between specific resume and job.

### **5. Bulk Processing**
```bash
POST /search/bulk
{
  "type": "job_to_resumes",
  "ids": ["job-1", "job-2", "job-3"],
  "limit_per_id": 5,
  "min_score": 65.0
}
```
Process multiple jobs/resumes in a single request.

## 🎮 **How to Use**

### **1. Start the API**
```bash
cd /home/ganesh/Desktop/project-x
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/api/similarity_search_api.py
```
API runs on `http://localhost:5001`

### **2. Test with Sample Data**
```bash
# Health check
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/health

# Test search (requires real OpenSearch data)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/search/resumes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job_id": "your-job-id", "limit": 5, "min_score": 70.0}'
```

### **3. Integration with Your AWS Data**
Your existing Lambda functions already create the right data structure:
- **Resume documents** in `resumes` index
- **Job description documents** in `job-descriptions` index
- **Titan embeddings** for semantic similarity
- **Claude metadata extraction** for structured matching
