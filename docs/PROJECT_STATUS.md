### **🌐 Day 5-6: Web Interface & User Experience**
- [ ] **Upload Interface** - Web forms for resume and job description uploads
- [ ] **Search Interface** - Web-based search with filters and results display
- [ ] **Matching Dashboard** - Visual interface for candidate-job matching
- [ ] **Admin Panel** - Manage uploaded documents and view analytics

### **📈 Day 7-8: Advanced Features**

- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Process multiple documents, batch matching
- [ ] **Export Features** - Generate reports, export candidate lists
- [ ] **Notification System** - Email alerts for new matches

### **🚀 Day 9-10: Production & Optimization**
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Improve processing speed and search response times
- [ ] **Security Hardening** - Authentication, authorization, data encryption
