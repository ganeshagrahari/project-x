## 🚀 **OPERATIONAL FEATURES**

### **📡 Live API Endpoints (Production Ready)**

**Base URL**: `https://gkw40ufkhe.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`

| **Endpoint** | **Method** | **Function** | **Response Time** |
|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `/health` | GET | System health check | <200ms |
| `/search/resumes` | POST | Find candidates for job | 2-3 seconds |
| `/search/jobs` | POST | Find jobs for candidate | 2-3 seconds |
| `/match/detailed` | POST | Detailed compatibility analysis | 2-3 seconds |

### **🎯 Advanced Matching Algorithm**

Our proprietary **7-component similarity scoring system**:

1. **📝 Skills Matching** (30% weight) - Technical and soft skills alignment
2. **💼 Experience Matching** (25% weight) - Years of experience compatibility  
3. **🎓 Education Matching** (15% weight) - Degree and qualification relevance
4. **📍 Location Matching** (10% weight) - Geographic proximity scoring
5. **🔤 Semantic Similarity** (10% weight) - AI-powered content understanding
6. **💰 Salary Compatibility** (5% weight) - Compensation expectations alignment
7. **⚡ Role Suitability** (5% weight) - Job level and responsibility fit

**Result**: Overall compatibility score (0-100%) with detailed explanations.
